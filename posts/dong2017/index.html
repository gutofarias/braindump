        <h1>dong2017 | Dual-Quaternion-Based Fault-Tolerant Control for Spacecraft Tracking With Finite-Time Convergence</h1>
        <p>A fault-tolerant sliding modes controller using dual quaternions is proposed for a target-pursuer spacecraft tracking. The proposed controller can achieve a few desired properties as tracking error converging to zero within a choosed finite time. The faults can be partial or total actuator power loss, actuator offset and locking.
The controller is used in a simulation showing promising results.</p>
<h2 id="info">Info</h2>
<p>Results are presented for a study of dual       extendash quaternion-based fault-tolerant control for spacecraft tracking. First, a six-degrees-of-freedom dynamic model under a dualquaternion-based description is employed to describe the relative coupled motion of a target-pursuer spacecraft tracking system. Then, a novel fault-tolerant control method is proposed to enable the pursuer to track the attitude and the position of the target even though its actuators have multiple faults. Furthermore, based on a novel time-varying sliding manifold, finite-time stability of the closed-loop system is theoretically guaranteed, and the convergence time of the system can be given explicitly. Multiple-task capability of the proposed control law is further demonstrated in the presence of disturbances and parametric uncertainties. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed control method.</p>

The direct kinematics equations are derived using DQ and through manipulating the equations they can solve it for the inverse kinematics problem. Nothing too fancy or new.\nInfo The industrial grade FUM articulated arm is a six-axis robot arm, here on referred to as, FUM 6R-20, designed by Ferdowsi University of Mashhad Robotics Lab. In this paper, an explicit inverse kinematics solution for the industrial grade FUM 6R-20 is presented. The dual quaternion, DQ, method is presented. This method uses two quaternions, one for orientation and one for position to represent the kinematics equations of the robot. The DQ method avoids the wrist singularity as a result of the rotation matrices. It is shown that this approach eliminates the wrist singularity and the gimbal lock problem. The Simulink as well as the SolidWorks models of the FUM 6R-20 are also developed. All eight inverse kinematics solutions are obtained. Three random positions and orientations in space are selected and results of the closed-form solutions are verified with the results of both Simulink and SolidWorks software.\nNotes The paper solves the inverse kinematics of an specific serial 6dof industrial arm using dual quaternions.

The results show better results for the Maneuver Regulation than the Trajectory Tracking.\nInfo The adoption of the dual quaternion formalism to represent the pose (position and orientation) of a rigid body allows to design a single controller to regulate both its position and its attitude. In this letter, we adopt such a pose representation to develop an exponentially stable maneuver regulation control law, ensuring robust path following in the presence of disturbances. The designed solution relies on the feedback linearized model of the dual quaternion based dynamics of the rigid body. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed maneuver regulation approach when compared with trajectory tracking in a noisy scenario.\nNotes Resumo The work proposes a Maneuver Regulation Feedback Linearization Controller using dual quaternions for a 6Dof free body.

N√£o li. S√≥ sei que usa os par√¢metros de Study e aplica num rob√¥ m√©dico paralelo\nTODO husty2019 The authors proposes a new method to parametrize parallel mechanisms using Study parameters, applying it in a mechanism to help in the lower limb rehabilitation process of post-stroke patients.\nVantagens [1/2] DONE Compara√ß√£o com HTM [3/3] DONE pham2018 The proposed controller is tested using DQ and HTM. The result is that the DQ controller is almost twice as fast to compute.\nDONE yacob2020 The common way to compensate variation is using HTM. Using DQ the modeling of the problem became easier as some steps became unnecessary obtaining the same result. Also, DQ allowed to analize other types of form error which the classical model can not analize.\nDONE mirandadefarias2019 The performance of the algorithm using DQ is compared to using HTM, and the result is favorable to DQ, maybe like 33% less cost in terms of number of operations.\nTODO T√©cnica usando DQ melhor do que as mais comuns [0/3] TODO wang2018 Method for frame calibration: The result was much favorable to the dual quaternion method when compared to a quaternion method and a Procrustes Analysis. The authors credits the higher precision of dual quaternions due to the fact that it computes rotation and translation coupled, so there is no error propagation when computing one and using the result to compute the other.\nTODO fu2020 The article concludes that the DQ methodology offers higher calibration accurary when compared to existing methods.\nTODO schwung2021 It applies two different neural networks, a DQ Recurrent NN (DQRNN) and a DQ Long Short Term Memory NN (DQLSTM). DQLSTM obtained a higher accuracy than DQRNN and when we compare it with a normal LSTM the DQLSTM got half the root mean square error (RMSE). So it performed really well.\nHyper-Dual Numbers [1/1] DONE cohen2020 The authors applies for the first time Hyper-Dual Quaternions. Finding a compact representation of pose and its derivative in a single element. Being able to compute kinematics and differential kinematics in only one pass.\nOrigami [3/3] DONE cai2016 The authors develop a method to check for the rigid foldability of multi-vertex cylindrical origami using dual quaternions. It\u0026rsquo;s a multi step method, one of the steps uses quaternions and the other uses dual quaternions.\nDONE jianguo2017 The paper studies the rigid foldability of a cylindrical origami with Kresling patterns concluding that it is not rigidly foldable. DQs are used in the method that analyses the ridid foldability.\nDONE wu2010 The work uses the correspondence between single-vertex rigid origami and spherical linkage to model it as quaternions and the correspondence of multi-vertex rigid origami and spatial linkage to model it as dual quaternions.\nDQ Neural Networks [2/2] DONE schilling2019 The author uses Mean of Multiple Computations (MMC) as a hierarchical recurrent neural network to model a redundant robot. The technique generates a lot of simple equations that converge to a feasible solution where there are many ways for the same pose of the end-effector. Using dual quaternions components in the neural network, the author can approximate transformations by interpolation, which is shown to be a great advantage of DQs. At the end, the author shows the viability of the proposed solution applying it to a complex robot consisting of two arms each having 7 DoF.\nDONE schwung2021 The work uses Dual-Quaternions Neural Networks to predict the behavior (physics) of a simulated system of masses inside a box. So the neural network predicts rigid body movement.\nThe authors say that using DQ in a neural network allows to incorporate physical bias into the prediction task. I.e., just by using the DQ we are already favoring the task of rigid body movement prediction, due to how DQ relates to this task.\nIt applies two different neural networks, a DQ Recurrent NN (DQRNN) and a DQ Long Short Term Memory NN (DQLSTM). DQLSTM obtained a higher accuracy than DQRNN and when we compare it with a normal LSTM the DQLSTM got half the root mean square error (RMSE). So it performed really well.\nMachining [2/2] DONE zhao2017 The paper proposes a dual quaternion B-Spline approximation method for using in five-axis CNC machines. The advantages of the method are: reduced computation time, reduced storage consuption, reduced number of control points. Also using the dual quaternionic method can eliminate the fitting oscillatory and solve the parameter synchronization problem simultaneously (no idea what this two mean).\nDONE yacob2020 The authors use DQ to compensate for variations in machining process. The variations are differences between the ideal/projected piece and the obtained through machining. The common way to compensate variation is using HTM. Using DQ the modeling of the problem became easier as some steps became unnecessary obtaining the same result. Also, DQ allowed to analize other types of form error which the classical model can not analize.\nMotion Planning [1/1] DONE oh_study_2017 Alternatively to motion interpolation, oh_study_2017 uses differential geometry and dual curvature theory. The author claims that it makes the expressions simpler and intuitive.\nRobotics [3/4] DONE Dual Robots [2/2] DONE chandra2018 The work uses what I think can be classified as a Dual Robot but they call a Dual-Arm robot. The authors use DQ to describe and control the coordinated motion of the arms of the robot. In order to do that, the work defines three reference frames and uses Relative Jacobians. Also they parametrize the task to be performed by a Virtual Mechanism that conects both arms. It is an interesting idea, since by doing that they can impose restrictions to the robot arms movement by the layout of the virtual mechanism. So by using this, the whole modeling looks like a two chains parallel robot.\nDONE fu2020 DONE SLAM [2/2] DONE cheng2016 Parametrizes the SLAM (Simultaneous Location and Mapping) problem using dual-quaternions instead of HTM. The problem is solved through a graph approach that in the DQ formulation can have DQs in the vertices and in the edges, because DQs can represent both the state and the restrictions. The proposed solution improves the computational performance when compared to the same approach using HTM.\nDONE bultmann2019 SLAM using an DQ unscented filter and using the stero visual data. N√£o tenho muito a dizer porque n√£o li muito.\nDONE Aerial Manipulator [1/1] DONE abaunza2017 The work presents modeling and control of a quadcopter with an robotic arm attached, forming a aerial manipulator. Both modeling and control uses dual quaternions. The work is very similar to abaunza_quadrotor_2016 (same authors)\nTODO Set-Point Control [0/1] TODO pham2018 The paper implements a set-point controller for an industrial 6DOF robot using Dual Quaternions. The authors computes the direct kinematics using DQ and differential kinematics using DQ as vectors in R8. The error equation is manipulated in order to obtain a matrix times a variable, but the matrix represents the system dynamics. This matrix is then writen in Laplace Domain and becomes a Transference Matrix, so Classic Control techniques can be used. Using this approach, two different control laws are generated using the Jacobian Matrix (which are compared). The authors state that the proposed controllers does not have the best performance, compared to more sophisticated controllers, but it is simple to implement and using Laplace it is possible to tune the controller using dynamic system parameteres as damping factor and natural frequency.\nEstimation [3/3] DONE sveier2018 The author presents a Moving Horizon Estimator for pose estimation using Dual Quaternions. They were able to formulate the cost function in terms of the DQ product and so satisfying the unitaryness constraint. Also they discretize the DQ and used a Caley transform presented in an article of Selig. The resulting estimator was more accurate them DQ-MEKF (DQ Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter) and T-UKF (Twistor-bases Unscented Kalman Filter) which the author attributes to the moving horizon strategy (so not only the last result is used).\nDONE dong2019 The authors develop a Dual Quaternion based 6-DOF observer and controller. The controller has a PD-like structure. The observer and controller are validated through simulation of a spacecraft in absensce of both translational and angular velocity measurements.\nDONE sveier2020 The authors develop a Dual Quaternion Particle Filter and test it in the pose estimation of a hanging payload using point clouds data from a Kinect. The pose estimation is then validated showing accurate results.\nCalibration [2/2] DONE wang2018 The work proposes a method for calibrating the transformation between the inertial/world frame and the robot frame. It uses a sensor to measure the position of the end-effector and calibrates the dual quaternion resposible to acheive the transformation.\nThe result was much favorable to the dual quaternion method when compared to a quaternion method and a Procrustes Analysis. The authors credits the higher precision of dual quaternions due to the fact that it computes rotation and translation coupled, so there is no error propagation when computing one and using the result to compute the other.\nDONE fu2020 Interesting article about coordinate calibration of dual robots using dual quaternions. The problem itself is very interesting, we have two robot coordinates system, one camera coordinate system and one coordinate system relative to the object being held. So in order to relate all this coordinates systems and assure that they are calibrated, the authors calibrate a hand-eye, a robot-robot and a tool-flange transformations.\nFormation Control [2/2] DONE giribet2021 The authors present a cluster-space formation control and apply it to leader-follower configuration using dual quaternions and reducing steady-state errors when compared to previous works. Experiments are made to validade the formation control using a ground and an aerial vehicles, and using two aerial vehicles.\nDONE huang2017 The work proposes a formation control using dual quaternions, the formation error is controlled through a sliding modes controller and one term is added for collision avoidance using Artificial Potential Function.\nWhole-Body [1/1] DONE silva2018 The papers proposes a whole-body control using Feedback Linearization in a DQ framework. Experiments are made using a nonholonomic mobile ground vehicle with 5-DOF manipulator arm.\nAerospace [4/4] DONE dong2018 The work shows the control of a Rendezvous and Docking process using dual quaternions to describe the kinematics and formulate two restrictions, one for the line of sight of the chaser to the target spacecraft and other to ensure a safe approach path from the chaser to the target in order to not hit any external equipament of the target. The authors use Artificial Potential Functions to formulate the control problem and perform a Lyapunov Stability Analysis.\nDONE valverde2018 The work describes an framework to derive the dynamics of a satellite, but it can be used to a general serial mechanism (at least I think), the proposed framework works with revolute, prismatic, cylindrical, spherical and planar joints. The equations are computed using dual quaternions and Newton-Euler formulation.\nDONE sun2020 Uses dual quaternions to model an eletromagnetic force with applications in satellites. Also derives the dynamics equations of the satellites subject to this force.\nDONE reynolds2020 It uses dual quaternions in the powered descent guidance problem. The article uses several restrictions in the control formulation, it uses a line-of-sight restriction (a new type they call slant-range-triggered line-of-sight), also a restriction as a window for the allowed values of the control effort (propulsion power). The control problem is solved through a nonconvex optimization problem.\nControl [0/0] Erro [1/1] DONE figueredo_robust_2013 Nova m√©trica de erro\nMPC [1/1] DONE lee_optimal_2015 Citar junto de lee_constrained_2017.\nKinematic Control [1/1] DONE ozgur2016 T√° na parte de Serial Mechanism\nFeedback Linearization [2/2] DONE antonello2018 The work proposes a Maneuver Regulation Feedback Linearization Controller using dual quaternions for a 6Dof free body.

The controller is proved to be asymptotically stable using Lyapunov.\nSliding Modes [2/2] DONE dong2017 A fault-tolerant sliding modes controller using dual quaternions is proposed for a target-pursuer spacecraft tracking. The proposed controller can achieve a few desired properties as tracking error converging to zero within a choosed finite time. The faults can be partial or total actuator power loss, actuator offset and locking. The controller is used in a simulation showing promising results.\nDONE huang2017 \\(H_\\infty\\) [1/1] DONE figueredo_robust_2013 Controle robusto do tipo \\(H_\\infty\\)\nfigueredo_robust_2013 | Robust kinematic control of manipulator robots using dual quaternion representation\nResolved-Acceleration Control [1/1] DONE chandra2020 The authors propose a new controller using Resolved-Acceleration Control (looks like a feedback linearization) for the trajectory tracking of serial robotic manipulators using dual quaternions and based on screw theory. The controller is compared to a uncoupled controller (which separates translation and orientation) getting similar results, actually performed worse on position but better on orientation.\nSerial Mechanism [2/2] DONE ozgur2016 Very interesting article of kinematic modeling and control of robotic arms. It uses a Screw Theory approach to model the kinematics, much like Successive Screws, but using only one frame, doesn\u0026rsquo;t need a convenient frame. Also the metodology is mind opening someway because the authors model the rotations from end-effector to base, and not the opositte, which in my opinion is easier to understand because going from end to base the successive rotations are not carried by the previous rotations.\nDONE amininan2017 The paper solves the inverse kinematics of an specific serial 6dof industrial arm using dual quaternions. The direct kinematics equations are derived using DQ and through manipulating the equations they can solve it for the inverse kinematics problem. Nothing too fancy or new.\nParallel Mechanism [1/1] DONE shabani2021 The authors uses dual quaternions to formulate closure loop equations as a system of multiaffine equations, they then introduce a new branch-and-prune method tailored to this type of equations to solve the system which can reduce computing time up to 2 orders of magnitude compared to traditional approaches.\nDynamics [2/2] DONE valverde2018 The work describes an framework to derive the dynamics of a satellite, but it can be used to a general serial mechanism (at least I think), the proposed framework works with revolute, prismatic, cylindrical, spherical and planar joints. The equations are computed using dual quaternions and Newton-Euler formulation.\nDONE mirandadefarias2019 The work do a performace study on an Recursive Newton-Euler Inverse Dynamics Algorithm using dual quaternions. The algorithm uses Newton-Euler formulation to compute the kinematics and given the desired accelerations and external forces, computes the necessary torques of the motors to drive the system.\nThey use dual quaternions in the kinematics and kinetics, for the inertia they create an inertia function (so not explicitily a matrix). They use a screw theory approach for the kinematics, not using DH.\nThe performance of the algorithm using DQ is compared to using HTM, and the result is favorable to DQ, maybe like 33% less cost in terms of number of operations.\nDesvantagens [0/0] DONE Adicionar as refer√™ncias lidas.

The study parameters of SE(3) are used to describe the robot kinematic chains, but, rather than directly analyzing the mobile platform motion, the joint-space of the mechanism is studied by eliminating the Study parameters. From the loop equations of the joint-space characterization, new parameterizations are defined, which enable the placement of a mobile frame on any mechanical element within the parallel robot. A case study is presented for a medical parallel robotic system in which the joint-space characterization is achieved and based on a new defined parameterization, the kinematics for displacement, velocities, and accelerations are studied. A numerical simulation is presented for the derived kinematic models, showing how the medical robot guides the medical tool (ultrasound probe) on an imposed trajectory.\nNotes Resumo Muito grande.

Maps represented by point clouds of ORB-features are incrementally built and landmarks are updated with an unscented transform-based method. In order to get reliable measurements during the update, an optical flow-based approach is proposed to remove false feature associations.

Combined with the technology of origami folding, foldable structures derive more diversified models, and the foldable structures in cylindrical shape are mainly studied in this paper. Some researchers use the theory of quaternion representing spatial fixed-point rotation and construct the rotating vector model to obtain the quaternion rotation sequence method (QRS method) analyzing origami, but the method is very limited and not suitable for the cylindrical foldable structures. In order to solve the problem, a new method is developed, which combines the QRS method and the dual quaternion method. After analyzing the folding angle via the QRS method for multi-vertex crease system and calculating the coordinates of all vertices via the dual quaternion, the rigid foldability can be checked. Finally, two examples are carried out to confirm validity and versatility of the method.\nNotes Resumo The authors develop a method to check for the rigid foldability of multi-vertex cylindrical origami using dual quaternions.

The problem is solved through a graph approach that in the DQ formulation can have DQs in the vertices and in the edges, because DQs can represent both the state and the restrictions. The proposed solution improves the computational performance when compared to the same approach using HTM.\nInfo This paper presents a new parameterization approach for the graph-based SLAM problem and reveals the differences of two popular over-parameterized ways in the optimization procedure. In the SALM problem, constraints or relative transformations between any two poses are generally separated into translations plus 3D rotations, which are then described in a homogeneous transformation matrix (HTM) to simplify computational operations. This however introduces added complexities in frequent conversions between the HTM and state variables, due to their different representations. This new approach, unit dual quaternion (UDQ), describes a spatial transformation as a screw with only 8 elements. We show that state variables can be directly represented by UDQs, and how their relative transformations can be written with the UDQ product, without the trivial computations of HTM. Then, we explore the performances of the unit quaternion and the axis extendash angle representations in the graph-based SLAM problem, which have been successfully applied to over parameterize perturbations under the assumption of small errors. Based on public synthetic and real-world datasets in 2D and 3D environments, experimental results show that the proposed approach reduces greatly the computational complexity while obtaining the same optimization accuracies as the HTM-based algorithm, and the axis extendash angle representation is superior to be the quaternion in the case of poor initial estimations.\nNotes Resumo Parametriza o problema chamado de SLAM (Simultaneous Location and Mapping) usando quat√©rnios duais no lugar de matrizes de transforma√ß√£o homog√™neas.

The proposed controller can achieve a few desired properties as tracking error converging to zero within a choosed finite time. The faults can be partial or total actuator power loss, actuator offset and locking. The controller is used in a simulation showing promising results.\nInfo Results are presented for a study of dual extendash quaternion-based fault-tolerant control for spacecraft tracking. First, a six-degrees-of-freedom dynamic model under a dualquaternion-based description is employed to describe the relative coupled motion of a target-pursuer spacecraft tracking system. Then, a novel fault-tolerant control method is proposed to enable the pursuer to track the attitude and the position of the target even though its actuators have multiple faults. Furthermore, based on a novel time-varying sliding manifold, finite-time stability of the closed-loop system is theoretically guaranteed, and the convergence time of the system can be given explicitly. Multiple-task capability of the proposed control law is further demonstrated in the presence of disturbances and parametric uncertainties. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed control method.\nNotes Resumo A fault-tolerant sliding mode controller using dual quaternions is proposed for a target-pursuer spacecraft tracking.

        "content": "The authors develop a Dual Quaternion based 6-DOF observer and controller. The controller has a PD-like structure. The observer and controller are validated through simulation of a spacecraft in absensce of both translational and angular velocity measurements.\nInfo Based on the dual-quaternion description, a smooth six-degree-of-freedom observer is proposed to estimate the incorporating linear (translational) and angular velocity, called the dual-angular velocity, for rigid bodies. To establish the observer, some important properties of dual vectors and dual quaternions are presented and proved, additionally, the kinematics of dualtransformation matrices is deduced, and the transition relationship between dual quaternions and dual transformation matrices is subsequently analyzed. An important feature of the observer is that all estimation states are ensured to be C{\\(infty\\)} continuous, and estimation errors are shown to exhibit asymptotic convergence if the signals to be estimated are bounded. Furthermore, to achieve tracking control objectives, the proposed observer is combined with an independently designed proportional-derivative-like feedback control law (using full-state feedback), and a special Lyapunov ``strictification\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; process is employed to ensure a separation property between the observer and the controller, which further guarantees almost global asymptotic stability of the closed-loop tracking error dynamics. Numerical simulation results for a prototypical spacecraft pose tracking mission application are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.\nNotes Resumo The authors develop a Dual Quaternion based 6-DOF observer and controller.

Very good introduction.\nInfo This paper addresses the H\\(infty\\) robust control problem for robot manipulators using unit dual quaternion representation, which allows an utter description of the end-effector transformation without decoupling rotational and translational dynamics. We propose three different H\\(infty\\) control criteria that ensure asymptotic convergence, whereas reducing the influence of disturbances upon the system stability. Also, with a new metric of dual quaternion error in SE(3) we prove independence from robot coordinate changes.

        "content": "Interesting article about coordinate calibration of dual robots using dual quaternions. The problem itself is very interesting, we have two robot coordinates system, one camera coordinate system and one coordinate system relative to the object being held. So in order to relate all this coordinates systems and assure that they are calibrated, the authors calibrate a hand-eye, a robot-robot and a tool-flange transformations.\nThe article concludes that the DQ methodology offers higher calibration accurary when compared to existing methods.\nInfo Coordinate calibration accuracy is a prerequisite for the achievement of collaborative motion of dual robots, and visual positioning. In the case of AXB=YCZ, the associated hand-eye (X), robot-robot (Y), and tool-flange (Z) coordinate relationships need to be determined in order to provide accurate data for dual-robot manipulation. The classical independent estimations and separable solving of rotational and translational components, inevitably induce certain levels of inaccuracy and inconsistency. To this end, the work presented herein describes an efficient approach based on dual quaternion (DQ), to the calibration of the hand-eye (X), robot-robot (Y), tool-flange (Z) transformations, corresponding to the dual-robot collaborative motion. After establishing a closedform kinematic equation for dual robots in DQ form, the calibration process is divided into two steps: 1) the hand-eye transformation (X) calibration is performed by letting the one robot with the visual sensor move freely, while keeping the other robot with the end-tool in a fixed configuration, thereby allowing the calibration result to be obtained by solving the DQ-based linear equations with the SVD algorithm; 2) the simultaneous calibration of robot-robot (Y) and tool-flange (Z) is transformed into a DQ-based equation, and the results are obtained in a similar way. A simulation analysis is carried out, accounting for the presence of noise levels and different data pairs, while calibration experiments are also conducted to verify the accuracy and efficacy of the proposed method.\nNotes Resumo Interesting article about coordinate calibration of dual robots using dual quaternions.

DQs are used in the method that analyses the ridid foldability.\nInfo Rigid origami is seen as a fundamental model in many self-folding machines. A key issue in designing origami is the rigid/non-rigid foldability. The kinematic and foldability of Kresling origami, which is based on an origami pattern of the vertex with six creases, are studied in this paper. The movement of the singlevertex is firstly discussed. Based on the quaternion method, the loop-closure equation of the vertex with six creases is obtained. Then the multi-transformable behavior of the single vertex is investigated. Furthermore, the rigid foldability of origami patterns with multi-vertex are investigated with an improved dual quaternion method, which is based on studying the folding angle and the coordinates of all vertices. It can be found that the Kresling cylinder is not rigidly foldable.\nNotes Resumo The paper studies the rigid foldability of a cylindrical origami with Kresling patterns concluding that it is not rigidly foldable.

That would be a problem for a trajectory tracking, but a maneuver regulation can just perform a time warping so that you can match the trajectory already where you are. The trajectory would be the same but with a time offset. Also, as I understood, it just adjusts the initial time of the trajectory it doesnt keep always adjusting.

Here we structure the forward kinematic description with screws and line displacements rather than the well established Denavit-Hartemberg parameters, thus accounting better efficiency, compactness and simpler dynamical models. Furthermore, the backwards iteration uses the previously calculated values for estimating the joint space torques. In addition, a cost analysis of the main Dual Quaternions operations and of the Newton-Euler inverse dynamics algorithm as a whole is made and compared with other results in the literature.\nNotes Resumo The work do a performace study on an Recursive Newton-Euler Inverse Dynamics Algorithm using dual quaternions.

Robot motion can be represented as motion properties of the ruled surface generated by trajectory of the Tool Center Point (TCP). The linear and angular properties of the six degree-of-freedom motion of end-effector are computed using the explicit formulas and functions from curvature theory and dual curvature theory. This paper explains the complete dualization of ruled surface and shows that the linear and angular motion applied using the method of dual curvature theory is more accurate and less complex.\nNotes Resumo The work describes the trajectory of the robot\u0026rsquo;s end effector by using Differential Geometry and Dual Curvature Theory instead of Motion Interpolation.

Efficiency is in less computer memory usage, in fast computation of the equations, in singularity-free representation of task space, in robustness to numerical errors, and in compactness of the representations.

The authors computes the direct kinematics using DQ and differential kinematics using DQ as vectors in R8. The error equation is manipulated in order to obtain a matrix times a variable, but the matrix represents the system dynamics. This matrix is then writen in Laplace Domain and becomes a Transference Matrix, so Classic Control techniques can be used. Using this approach, two different control laws are generated using the Jacobian Matrix (which are compared). The authors state that the proposed controllers does not have the best performance, compared to more sophisticated controllers, but it is simple to implement and using Laplace it is possible to tune the controller using dynamic system parameteres as damping factor and natural frequency.\nAlso, the proposed controller is tested using DQ and HTM.

Forward and inverse models are important concepts in motor control. Usually, it is distinguished between these function and there are different models for each individual function or there are even models that are specific to individual behaviors. Here, we present a concept of a core internal model of the body which can act both as an inverse and forward model. In addition, it provides a mechanism for integration of sensory data and can be in this way grounded in the continuous interaction with the environment. In this article, a hierarchical Mean of Multiple Computations neural network is presented that is based on an axis-angle representation of joint movements using dual quaternions. It is shown in detail how the network provides a solution for the forward kinematic problem applied for the case of a seven degrees of freedom robotic arm. Furthermore, it is used in a complex scenario of a bimanual movement task.

        "content": "The work uses Dual-Quaternions Neural Networks to predict the behavior (physics) of a simulated system of masses inside a box. So the neural network predicts rigid body movement.\nThe authors say that using DQ in a neural network allows to incorporate physical bias into the prediction task. I.e., just by using the DQ we are already favoring the task of rigid body movement prediction, due to how DQ relates to this task.\nIt applies two different neural networks, a DQ Recurrent NN (DQRNN) and a DQ Long Short Term Memory NN (DQLSTM). DQLSTM obtained a higher accuracy than DQRNN and when we compare it with a normal LSTM the DQLSTM got half the root mean square error (RMSE). So it performed really well.\nInfo This paper presents a novel approach for the data based prediction of rigid body movements. To this end, we combine data based learning with a physically motivated neural network architecture using the theory of dual quaternions. Particularly, we develop a novel neural network architecture based on dual quaternion algebra which is particular suitable for representing rigid body movements. To account for multistep predictions and the inherent dynamics of rigid bodies, we particularly focus on recurrent neural networks. As such we propose both dual quaternion recurrent neural networks as well as dual quaternion long short term memories. We apply the approach to a simplified simulation environment developed using the discrete element method which allows for a very detailed simulation of the movements. The obtained results underline the applicability and potential of the approach in terms of improved prediction performance.\nNotes Resumo The work uses Dual-Quaternions Neural Networks to predict the behavior (physics) of a simulated system of masses inside a box. So the neural network predicts rigid body movement.\nThe authors says that using DQ in a neural network allows to incorporate physical byas into the prediction task. I.e., just by using the DQ we are already favoring the task of rigid body movement prediction, due to how DQ relates to this task.\nIt applies two different neural networks, a DQ Recurrent NN (DQRNN) and a DQ Long Short Term Memory NN (DQLSTM). DQLSTM obtained a higher accuracy than DQRNN and when we compare with a normal LSTM the DQLSTM got half the root square mean error (RSME). So it performed really well.\n",

The controller, whose reference is a unit dual quaternion representing the desired end-effector pose, acts as a dynamic trajectory generator for the end-effector, and input signals for both nonholonomic mobile base and manipulator arm are generated by using the pseudoinverse of the whole-body Jacobian matrix. In order to deal with the nonholonomic constraints, the input signal to the mobile base generated by the wholebody motion control is properly remapped to ensure feasibility. The Lyapunov stability for the proposed controller is presented and experimental results on a real platform are performed in order to compare the proposed scheme to a traditional classic whole-body linear kinematic controller. The results show that, for similar convergence rate, the nonlinear controller is capable of generating smoother movements while having lower control effort than the linear controller.\nNotes Resumo The papers proposes a whole-body control using Feedback Linearization in a DQ framework.

The main scope is modeling the 3-axis coupled electromagnetic force using dual quaternion for its advantages in describing spiral motion with translation and rotation motion simultaneously. The derivation procedure relies on a far field model of the electromagnetic force, and also, the force is re-formulized. Final equations show the dual quaternion dynamics can express the relative motion caused by the electromagnetic force acting on the position and attitude integrally.

The pose estimation is then validated showing accurate results.\nInfo This article presents a particle filter for pose estimation using unit dual quaternion kinematics. The eight-parameter unit dual quaternion is used for global representation of the pose, whereas the six parameters of the dual modified Rodrigues parameters (MRPs) are used for local pose representation in the state-space model. The dual MRPs enable estimates of the mean and the covariance to be calculated from the particles without violating the algebraic constraint of the unit dual quaternion. For verification of the filter and comparison with state of the art, we consider pose measurements available in the form of unit dual quaternions. Angular velocity and specific force measurements from a body-mounted inertial measurement unit are also considered in the filtering. We show through simulations that the suggested particle filter has comparable accuracy with a previously proposed unscented Kalman filter based on unit dual quaternions. We also consider a practical application where the pose of an arbitrary rigid object is estimated using a sequence of point clouds from a 3-D camera. A model point cloud of the object is displaced with the unit dual quaternion associated with each particle, and a fitting score is calculated between the displaced model point cloud and the measured point cloud from the 3-D camera. The likelihoods of the fitting scores are calculated from an exponential distribution and are used to update the weights of the particles. The system was verified in an experiment where the motion of a swinging payload hanging from a crane was estimated using a 3-D camera.\nNotes Resumo The authors develop a Dual Quaternion Particle Filter and test it in the pose estimation of a hanging payload using point clouds data from a Kinect.

The authors credits the higher precision of dual quaternions due to the fact that it computes rotation and translation coupled, so there is no error propagation when computing one and using the result to compute the other.\nInfo When the robot is required to execute a certain task in the world coordinate system (WCS), it is necessary to find the coordinate transformation between the robot base coordinate system (RBCS) and WCS to enable the high precision motion planning. This paper presents a simple and accurate method that allows a simultaneous computation of the coordinate transformations (i.e., rotation and translation) from WCS to RBCS. Based on the dual quaternion, the robot kinematic model and formulas for calculating the transformation are derived, which allow calculating the rotation and translation simultaneously. Taking the unit dual quaternion as a constraint, the Lagrangian multiplier method is employed to obtain the optimum transformation. Both simulation and experiment results show that higher calibration precision is obtained. The proposed approach has certain reference value and guiding sense for other calibration problems.\nNotes Resumo The work proposes a method for calibrating the transformation between the intertial/world frame and the robot frame.

        "content": "The work uses the correspondence between single-vertex rigid origami and spherical linkage to model it as quaternions and the correspondence of multi-vertex rigid origami and spatial linkage to model it as dual quaternions.\nInfo This paper examines the mathematical modelling of rigid origami, a type of origami where all the panels are rigid and can only rotate about crease lines. The rotating vector model is proposed, which establishes the loop-closure conditions among a group of characteristic vectors. By building up an explicit relationship between the single-vertex origami and the spherical linkage mechanism, the rotating vector model can conveniently and directly describe arbitrary three-dimensional configurations and can detect some self-intersection. Quaternion and dual quaternion are then employed to represent the origami model, based on which two numerical methods have been developed. Through examples, it has been shown that the first method can effectively track the entire rigid-folding procedure of an initially flat or a non-flat pattern with a single vertex or multiple vertices, and thereby provide judgment for its rigid foldability and flat foldability. Furthermore, its ability to rule out some self-intersecting configurations during folding is illustrated in detail, leading to its ability of checking rigid foldability in a more or less sufficient way. The second method is especially for analysing the multi-vertex origami. It can also effectively track the trajectories of multiple vertices during folding.\nNotes Resumo The work uses the correspondence between single-vertex rigid origami to model it as quaternions and the correspondence of multi-vertex rigid origami and spatial linkage to model it as dual quaternions.\n",
